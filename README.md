## 📜 About The Project

**Project HADES** is an academic project developed for the *"Information Modeling and Web Technologies"* course at the **University of Bologna**. 

The goal of this project is to explore how layout, typography, and interactive storytelling can enhance the digital museum experience. By analyzing artifacts from the game *Hades* (Supergiant Games) alongside their real-world archaeological inspirations (from the British Museum, The Met, Louvre, etc.), we create a dual narrative that appeals to both gamers and history enthusiasts.

### 🎯 Core Concept: The "Meta Mirror"
Every object in this exhibition exists in two states:
1.  **The Game Narrative:** Its function and lore within the *Hades* video game.
2.  **The Historical Narrative:** Its actual archaeological origin, material, and cultural significance.

## ✨ Key Features

This project utilizes advanced vanilla JavaScript and CSS techniques to create an immersive experience without external frameworks.

### 🕰️ Time Travel (Dynamic Theme Engine)
The site features a robust **Theme Switcher** that completely transforms the atmosphere, typography, and color palette based on historical periods:
* **1500-1800:** Baroque aesthetics with *Libre Caslon* typography.
* **1950-1990:** Pop-Art style with vibrant colors and *Bangers* font.
* **2035:** A futuristic Cyberpunk look with *Orbitron* font.
* *(And more...)*

### 🗺️ Interactive Map & Blueprint View
* **Grid & List Layout:** Fully responsive navigation through the game's levels (Tartarus, Asphodel, Elysium).
* **Cross-Fader Slider:** An interactive slider that seamlessly transitions the map from an artistic illustration to a schematic "Blueprint" view, revealing the architectural layout of the exhibition rooms.

### 🧠 Content Matrix (Accessibility)
To cater to different audiences (from casual gamers to academic researchers), every artifact description offers a 4-way toggle:
* **Content Level:** Simple vs. Complex
* **Language Tone:** Simple vs. Academic

### 📱 Mobile-First Design
* **Fixed & Sticky Headers:** Ensures navigation is always accessible.
* **Responsive Grid:** Automatically adjusts from museum-style grids to mobile-friendly lists.
* **Touch-Friendly:** Optimized tap targets and layout for mobile devices.

### 🔗 Dynamic QR Generation
* **Source Linking:** Every artifact generates an automatic QR code linking directly to the source museum (e.g., The Met, British Museum) for further research.

## 🛠️ Technical Structure

The project is built using pure **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)**. No heavy frameworks (React, Vue, Bootstrap) were used to ensure maximum performance and semantic code quality.
