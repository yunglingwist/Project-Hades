Charon in Hades is the quiet boatman of the Underworld. He carries souls across the rivers of the dead, and in the game he runs a shop where Zagreus can buy helpful items. He only speaks in deep groans, but Zagreus somehow understands him.
In the famous painting The Last Judgement by Michelangelo, Charon also appears. He is painted at the bottom of the scene, pushing souls out of his boat with his oar. He brings the damned to the judge of the Underworld.

In the game, Charon moves people across the Underworld; in the painting, he brings souls to their final fate. Both show him as someone who works quietly but powerfully.
Zagreus wants Charon to ferry him to the surface, but Charon refuses. In the painting too, Charon follows his duty strictly.
Even though the game is fun and the painting is serious, they both show Charon as someone who guides souls and stays silent, but always knows exactly where everyone belongs.
