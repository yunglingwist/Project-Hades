In Hades, Charon is the ferryman who sells goods to Zagreus. His role is mysterious, and he almost never speaks. He moves through the Underworld with ease, appearing whenever players need healing, boons, or upgrades.
The real-world connection to him comes from Michelangelo’s Last Judgement, painted in the Sistine Chapel. In this huge fresco, Charon is shown at the bottom right, aggressively forcing damned souls off his boat with his oar. This image comes from Dante’s Divine Comedy, where Charon carries sinners across the river Acheron.

The painting shows a giant scene of judgement: Christ at the center, saints above, angels blowing trumpets, blessed souls rising on one side, and the condemned falling on the other. Charon belongs to the bottom realm, where chaos, punishment, and fear rule.
In Hades, Charon is calmer and more neutral. He sells items rather than punishing sinners. Yet both versions show him as someone who stands between worlds — between safety and danger, between life and death.
The painting reflects fear, power, and religious meaning; the game reflects exploration and choice. Charon exists in both as a symbol of transition: someone who guides souls to where they must go, whether gently or harshly.
Even though the painting is about Christian judgement and the game is about Greek myth, both treat Charon as the keeper of boundaries, always present at the moment when a soul must move from one state to another.
