Charon’s Obol in Hades is not ordinary money; it is a resource tied to the Underworld’s rhythm. Zagreus loses it upon death, emphasizing its connection to the moment between life and afterlife. Charon hoards it endlessly for reasons even the Codex admits no one fully understands.
This mirrors ancient funerary practice. In graves across the Mediterranean, archaeologists have frequently found thin, uniface disks — coin-like objects not used in commerce but placed intentionally with the deceased. Their designs often copy the imagery of real silver drachms or staters, yet they are too light to function as currency.

These tokens served a spiritual purpose: they were the “Charon’s fare,” the coin required by the ferryman. Even imitations were acceptable, as the ritual itself mattered more than the monetary value.
The game’s Obol preserves this symbolic dimension. It is never saved or inherited; it exists only within a single journey, dissolving when life ends. In that way, it acts exactly like the burial token — useful only in the liminal period, the threshold between states.
While the game transforms the somber ritual into a mechanic of exploration and commerce, the underlying theme remains unchanged: some forms of currency belong not to the living world, but to the passage between worlds.
