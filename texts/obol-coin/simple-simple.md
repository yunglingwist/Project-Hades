In Hades, an Obol is the coin Zagreus uses to buy things from Charon. You earn Obols by fighting enemies, opening special chests, or selling boons. But if Zagreus dies, all of his Obols disappear.
In ancient times, people placed a small coin into the mouth or hand of the dead. This was meant to pay Charon, the ferryman who carried souls across the river of the Underworld.
Archaeologists have found very thin coins or coin-like tokens in graves. They were not real money; they were meant only for burial.

Just like in the game, the Obol wasn’t regular currency for life — it was symbolic.
The ancient tokens were light and had only one side, and they copied the designs of real coins. People believed the dead needed them for their final journey.
So in both the game and real history, the Obol is special: it is the last coin a person uses, not in life, but in death.
