In the game, Charon’s Obol is a temporary currency. Zagreus collects it during his escape attempts and spends it at Charon’s shop or Wells. The coin has value only inside the Underworld, and vanishes when Zagreus dies.
Historically, the concept of the Obol comes from ancient burial practices. Many cultures in the Greek world placed a coin on or inside the body of the deceased. This was intended as payment to Charon, the boatman who ferried souls across the river separating the living from the dead.
Archaeologists have uncovered thin, single-sided disk tokens in graves. These are not normal coins. They imitate real coin designs but are too light and fragile to have been used in daily trade.

These pseudo-coins belonged exclusively to the realm of death. They were created to accompany the dead, reflecting belief in the afterlife and the idea that one must pay to cross its boundaries.
In Hades, Obols function similarly: they represent movement, transition, and the cost of crossing thresholds. Zagreus uses them to progress through his journey, echoing how the ancient dead needed coinage to continue theirs.
Thus the in-game Obol mirrors the symbolic purpose of real burial tokens: a currency not of markets, but of passage — the price of reaching whatever lies beyond.
