Charon’s Obol in Hades is a currency defined by impermanence. It represents value only within the Underworld and evaporates upon Zagreus’s death, emphasizing its role as a liminal coin. The Codex describes the Underworld as a place overflowing with wealth deposited by the dead, yet these riches are largely symbolic. Charon alone interprets their value literally, stockpiling coinage for uncertain purposes — perhaps infinitely improving his boats, perhaps out of habit older than memory.
This fictional portrayal directly resonates with ancient funerary tradition. Across Greek burial sites, archaeologists have found thin, single-faced pseudo-coins modeled after legitimate coin types — Ephesian bee coins, Aradian ship prows, Athenian owl reverses, Sikyonian chimera emblems. These pieces lack the thickness, striking force, and wear characteristic of circulating currency. Their presence in graves reveals their function: they were tokens, not for market exchange but for ritual use, fulfilling the mythic requirement to pay the ferryman of the dead.

The symbolism is profound. Whereas real coins mediated economic interactions among the living, funerary obols mediated the metaphysical transition from life to death. Their material fragility — thin, often uniface, devoid of monetary durability — suggests their purpose was entirely spiritual. They were currency for a journey that was believed to be taken only once. The boundary-crossing nature of the token parallels Zagreus’s repeated attempts to traverse the Underworld.
Michelangelo’s Last Judgement and Dante’s Inferno further codify the presence of Charon as the gatekeeper of passage. In the Sistine Chapel fresco, Charon violently drives the damned from his boat toward the infernal judge Minos. In Dante, Charon’s boat is the threshold vehicle for souls entering the realm of punishment. In both works, Charon’s authority derives from the necessity of transition: no soul crosses without him, and no crossing happens without payment.
Supergiant’s interpretation preserves this archetype while transforming it. Charon’s Obol no longer determines a soul’s fate but the player’s trajectory. It becomes a transactional ritual within the narrative loop: Zagreus pays to progress, echoing ancient beliefs that the soul must pay to journey forward. The impermanence of the currency reinforces the ancient truth that no wealth survives death.
Thus, the archaeological pseudo-coin, the Renaissance fresco, Dante’s epic, and the game’s mechanic all converge on a single idea: there exists a form of currency that belongs exclusively to the borderlands of existence. The Obol is not merely money — it is the symbol of passage, of transition, and of the unbroken continuity between ancient ritual and modern storytelli
