Stygius’s myth describes it as a relic of a cosmic war, a weapon once wielded by gods before falling into disrepair. The archaeological sword it mirrors is a 1st-century Romano-British weapon whose condition reflects a similar story of use, breakage, and survival. Its blade is fractured, its edge corroded, and its handle decorated with old metal fittings that once belonged to a skilled soldier’s equipment.
In essence, both blades were used, damaged, and then left behind — yet they still communicate power.

The real sword, although broken nearly halfway up its blade, keeps its identity through its shape: a straight, flat blade suited for controlled thrusts, and a hilt built with carefully shaped metal pieces. The combination of Roman blade design and Celtic decorative style shows cultural blending at a frontier of the empire.
Stygius, with its “burning soul,” mirrors this layered identity. Though cracked and ancient, it becomes functional again when wielded by Zagreus — just as the archaeological sword becomes meaningful again when studied. Both serve as reminders of how weapons can outlast their original era and continue telling stories far beyond their time of use.
