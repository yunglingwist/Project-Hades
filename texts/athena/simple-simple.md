Athena in Hades is the goddess who helps you defend yourself. Her powers let you Deflect attacks and take less damage. She is calm, wise, and protective — the opposite of the violent gods.
The real-world history connected to her comes from ancient Athens, a place full of art and smart ideas. Long ago, the people of Athens won big battles and then built beautiful statues and temples. Many artists made sculptures of gods like Athena, Demeter, and Zeus. Athena was the protector of the city, and the most famous statue of her was a huge one made of gold and ivory.

In the game, Athena is the first Olympian who helps Zagreus, offering safety and guidance.
In real life, she represented wisdom, justice, and strategy — the same things Athens valued when it became powerful.
The statues from that time show goddess figures with flowing clothes and calm faces, just like Athena’s peaceful but strong attitude.
Both in myth and in the game, Athena teaches that strength is not just about fighting — it is also about clarity, thinking, and protecting what matters.
