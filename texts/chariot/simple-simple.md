In Hades, the Nemean Chariots are fast, wild chariots inspired by the famous Nemean Lion from the myths of Herakles. They rush endlessly across Elysium, always training, always racing, never stopping. They believe they are one with their chariots, just like warriors who trained with their horses and armor.
The real chariot that connects to this idea is an ancient parade chariot found in Italy. It was buried in a tomb and stayed hidden for thousands of years. When it was discovered, the chariot still had its bronze decorations, wooden parts, and even some ivory pieces. It was made for important people to ride in during ceremonies, not for war.

Like the Nemean Chariots in the game, the real chariot was beautifully decorated with heroic scenes. It had images of Achilles, his battles, and his rise to glory. The metalwork was bright and detailed.
In the game, the chariots never stop racing. In real life, the parade chariot was buried with its owner as a symbol of honor.
Both the real chariot and the Nemean Chariots show how ancient people respected heroes and believed that glory could last even after death.
