Aegis in Hades is a powerful but frightening shield. It used to belong to the gods when they fought the Titans, and even though it is broken now, a burning spirit still lives inside it. The real ancient shield it resembles was made over 2,000 years ago for a king named Pharnakes. It had a big star shape on the front and was made from very thin metal placed on top of wood or leather.
Both shields look strong and important, and both were connected to powerful leaders — one to kings, the other to gods.

The ancient shield’s metal was thin, so it was probably used in ceremonies, not real battle. Soldiers may have offered it to a god as a gift. Aegis in the game also feels like something more than a tool — it has a life and power of its own.
Just like the real shield showed a king’s identity, Aegis shows the history of the Titan War. Even though both shields are old and changed, they still tell their stories: one through its decorations, the other through its burning, living spirit.
