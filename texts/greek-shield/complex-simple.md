In the game, Aegis is a relic of the Titan War, once wielded by Zeus and Athena and now reduced to a chaotic, semi-alive fragment. Its nature is unstable: not a defensive tool but a violent force. The historical shield it resembles is a round bronze sheet from the kingdom of Pontos, carrying a star pattern and the name of King Pharnakes I. Although it looks impressive, it was made from very thin metal and was probably used in ceremonies rather than real combat.
In simple terms, both shields were created to represent power as much as to protect.

The real shield shows that ancient rulers used decorated weapons and armor to display identity. The star, the inscription, and the careful shaping of the rim acted like symbols of authority. Soldiers may have dedicated this shield to a local god to gain favor or celebrate victory.
Aegis in Hades works the same way: it tells the history of the gods who united to defeat the Titans. Even though it is broken and dangerous, it still acts like a symbol — one of memory, war, and divine force.
Both shields show how weapons can become something more than tools. They can carry stories, identities, and meanings long after the battles have ended.
