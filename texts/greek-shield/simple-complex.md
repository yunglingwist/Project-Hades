Aegis in the game is the shield used by Zeus and Athena when they fought the Titans. It is described as broken, filled with chaotic power, and unable to act like a normal shield. The real shield it resembles came from the kingdom of Pontos in ancient times. It carried a six-rayed star and the name of King Pharnakes. The metal was so thin that it needed wood or leather underneath, and the edge of the shield had tabs that helped attach it to its frame.
Like Aegis, this shield wasn’t only for defense — it also showed status and identity.

Ancient shields with royal inscriptions were often offered to gods in sanctuaries after military victories. They symbolized loyalty, divine support, and the authority of a king. The star design on the shield was a symbol used across Macedonia and its neighboring regions, often connected to power and royal lineage.
Aegis in Hades also represents more than protection. It is a symbol of the gods’ struggle, their unity against the Titans, and the extreme power they unleashed. The ancient shield honored a human king; Aegis carries the memory of divine war.
Both shields blur the line between function and meaning. One was used in ritual and to show allegiance to a king; the other stores living power, fear, and the memory of a cosmic battle — but both exist as reminders of authority, legacy, and moments where worlds changed.
