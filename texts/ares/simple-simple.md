Ares in Hades is the god of war who loves battle, strength, and destruction. His powers help Zagreus deal more damage, curse enemies with Doom, and create spinning Blade Rifts that tear through anything that touches them. He isn’t calm or careful like Athena — he represents the wild and violent side of war.
The real-world statue linked to him is a bronze sculpture of Mars, the Roman God of War. It was found in the ancient city of Zeugma. The statue shows a strong, proud warrior standing tall, made from dark metal that has survived many centuries.

Just like Ares in the game stands for power and aggression, the Mars statue also shows confidence and force. Even though it is very old, its shape still looks powerful. The statue was buried for a long time until archaeologists found it and began restoring it.
Ares in Hades appears suddenly, dramatically, offering dangerous boons. The statue of Mars, once hidden underground, now stands again — almost like rising back into the world of the living. Both the god and the statue remind us how war, strength, and fear can stay alive through time, even when buried.
