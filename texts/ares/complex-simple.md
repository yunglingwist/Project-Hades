In Hades, Ares stands as the god of unrestrained violence. He favors direct confrontation and revels in combat’s brutality. His gifts empower Zagreus with curses, spinning rifts, and destructive enhancements that emphasize overwhelming offense over defense.
The corresponding real artifact is a bronze statue of Mars from Zeugma — a nearly life-sized representation of the Roman war god. Its pose is calm yet powerful, embodying the ideal image of a warrior: composed, muscular, and commanding.

Although Ares in the game behaves fiercely, the statue of Mars communicates a different side of war: discipline and permanence. Its bronze form survived destruction, fires, collapses, and centuries of burial. Once restored, it regained its presence in the modern world.
This mirrors Ares’ nature in a simpler way: war leaves marks, but war also returns, again and again. The statue shows the lasting image of a warrior; Ares shows the living force of conflict.
Both represent how human cultures and myths shape the meaning of violence. One is frozen in bronze; the other moves in flame and shadow. Both remind us that war can be terrifying but also central to the stories civilizations tell.
